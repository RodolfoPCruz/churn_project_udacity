## Usage

bash

python churn_library.py 

This command executes the entire machine learning workflow, starting from dataset loading to model evaluation, seamlessly running all steps in between.

bash

python -c "from churn_library import perform_eda,  import_data, FILE_PATH; perform_eda(import_data(FILE_PATH))"

This command executes only exploratory data analysis.

## Features

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

  It performs EDA and saves the plots of univariate analysis and bivariate analysis.

- Feature engineering

- Modeling

- Model Evaluation

  It saves a classification report for each model and the ROC curves.

- Feature Importance
